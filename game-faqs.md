# Game FAQs

## When registering for an account, what does the class code refer to?

You must get your class code from your teacher. You cannot make a student account unless you have a valid class code.

## After I collide with a chest, how do I know what power-up I recieved?

Once you hit a chest, you will see text in the top right corner of the screen \(next to the timer\) that says which power up you got \(score boost, time boost, or retry\).

## How do I activate a retry?

Before you answer the question, you must click the retry button. You will automatically see the question again after answering it the first time.
